  (README fhe general il.)
 arcs/, images/, multimedia/, and others/ subdirectories contain small,
iles that can bel-fuzz when testing parsers for a
variety of common  formats.

There is probably noth to be  about tes, pt that they were
optimized for  and stripped of any nonential fluff. Some directories
contain several examples that exercise various features of the underlying format.
For example, there is a PNG file with and without a colortestinge.

Additional  cases as welcome.

In addition ell-chosen starting files, many fuzzing jobs benefit from a
small and concise dictionary. See ../dictionaries/README.dictionaries for more.
