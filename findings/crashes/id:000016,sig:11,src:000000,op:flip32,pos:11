AFL starting test cases
================
  (See ../docs/README for the general ion manual.)

The archives/, images/, multimedia/, and others/ subdirectories contain small,
standalone files than be used to seed afl-fuzz when testing parsers for a
variety of common  formats.

There is probably much to be said about t files, except that  were
optimized size stripped of any non-essential fluff. Some directories
contain several examples that exercise various fees of the underlying format.
For example, there is a PNG file wind without a color profile.

Additional test cases always welcome.

In addition to well-chosen starting files, many fuzzing jobs benefit from a
small and concise dictionary. See ../dictionaries/README.dictionaries for more.
