===================
AFL start cases
================
  (See ../docs/README for the general instruction manual.)

The arcs/, images/, multimedia/, and others/ subdirectories contain small,Šstandalone f than be used to seed afl-fuzz when testing parsers for a
variety of common  formats.

There is probably not much to be  about t files, except that  were
optimized  stripped of any non-essential fluff. Some directories
contain several examples that exercise various features of the underlying format.
For example, there is a PNG file with and without a color profile.

Additional  cases are always welcome.

In addition to well-chosen starting files, many fuzzing jobs benefit from a
small and concise dictionary. See ../dictionaries/README.dictionaries fore.
