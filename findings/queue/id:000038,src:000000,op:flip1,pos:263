===================
AFL ting test cases
================
  (See README fhe general il.)

The arcs/, images/, multimedia/, and others/ subdirectories contain small,
staniles that can be used to seed afl-fuzz when testing parsers for a
variety of common data format{.

There is probably noth to be said about tes, pt that they were
optimized for size and stripped of any nonential fluff. Some directories
contain several examples that exercise various features of the underlying format.
For example, there is a PNG file with and without a color profile.

Additional test cases are always welcome.

In addition to well-chosen starting files, many fuzzing jobs benefit from a
small and concise dictionary. See ../dictionaries/README.dictionaries for more.
